# Casa Amigo üè†

Casa Amigo is a tenant assistant Streamlit app aimed at reducing time spent by property managers to answer redundant questions from prospective/existing tenants while ensuring an excellent experience for tenants. 

## What it does

Casa Amigo uses AI to help tenants understand their rental agreements without reading through dense legal documents. Here's how it works:

1. **Document Processing**: The system reads and processes rental documents from a curated corpus using PyPDF and document parsing tools
2. **Vector Indexing**: LlamaIndex converts these documents into searchable vector store indices, allowing for semantic similarity searches
3. **Intelligent Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the system searches the vector indices to find relevant document sections
4. **Contextual Response**: GPT-4o-mini uses the retrieved document sections as context to generate accurate, document-grounded responses through RAG
5. **Memory Buffer**: Your conversation history is stored in a memory buffer, allowing the AI to maintain context across multiple questions

The app is specifically tailored for Singapore's rental market, including HDB regulations and expat-specific requirements but can be extended to global markets with the inclusion of the relevant corpus.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, LlamaIndex for document retrieval
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) with SQLAlchemy
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF, python-docx
