# Casa Amigo üè†

Casa Amigo is a tenant assistant Streamlit app aimed at reducing time spent by property managers to answer redundant questions from prospective/existing tenants while ensuring an excellent experience for tenants. 

## What it does

Casa Amigo uses AI to help tenants understand their rental agreements without reading through dense legal documents. Here's how it works:

1. **Document Processing**: The system reads and processes rental documents from a curated corpus using PyPDF and document parsing tools
2. **Vector Indexing**: LlamaIndex converts these documents into searchable vector store indices, allowing for semantic similarity searches
3. **Intelligent Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the system searches the vector indices to find relevant document sections
4. **Contextual Response**: GPT-4o-mini uses the retrieved document sections as context to generate accurate, document-grounded responses through RAG
5. **Memory Buffer**: Your conversation history is stored in a memory buffer, allowing the AI to maintain context across multiple questions

The app is specifically tailored for Singapore's rental market, including HDB regulations and expat-specific requirements but can be extended to global markets with the inclusion of the relevant corpus.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, LlamaIndex for document retrieval
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) with SQLAlchemy
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF, python-docx

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source ./venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your OpenAI API key (choose one method):

   **Option A: Environment Variable (for local development)**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   **Option B: Streamlit Secrets (recommended for deployment)**
   Copy the template and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.template .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```
   Then edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your API key:
   ```toml
   [openai]
   api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
   ```

   **Option C: Streamlit Cloud Deployment**
   When deploying to Streamlit Cloud:
   1. Go to your app dashboard on [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   2. Click on your app, then navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Secrets"
   3. Add the following configuration in the secrets editor:
   ```toml
   [openai]
   api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
   ```
   4. Click "Save" and wait for automatic redeployment
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure to include the `[openai]` section header - this is required for the app to find your API key in Streamlit Cloud.

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

The app will open in your browser.

## Deployment

### Streamlit Cloud

1. **Fork or clone** this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Go to** [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in
3. **Click "New app"** and connect your GitHub repository
4. **Set the main file path** to `src/app.py`
5. **Configure secrets** as described in Option C above
6. **Deploy** and your app will be live!

### Other Platforms

Casa Amigo can also be deployed on:
- **Heroku**: Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in the dashboard
- **Railway**: Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment variables
- **Render**: Set the API key in the environment variables section

For all deployment platforms, ensure your `requirements.txt` includes all necessary dependencies.
